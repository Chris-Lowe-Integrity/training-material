# Circos for Genomics Visualisation

---

### What is Circos

- Circular Graphics
- Complex + Finnicky configuration
- ... but beautiful visualisations
- Can visualise a huge range of data types

???
Many researchers find Circos overwhelming and complex. This tool can save them time and we will hopefully show them how to reproduce several plots from published papers.

---

### Circos in Galaxy

- Tool that produces a Circos Plot (PNG / SVG)
- Workflow compatible
- **Does only 90% of the work**
- The last 10% (ok plot â†’ amazing plot) is up to you (may require manual work.)
- Outputs configuration directory for manual tweaking

???
Emphasize that it will not produce production quality plots without a lot of work, and sometimes that work is painful in Galaxy Circos. We are actively trying to support as many of the features as possible from circos but there are some features we cannot support easily. Sometimes this means that they will have to download + install circos locally and then manually edit their configuration files.

We cannot support them uploading these edited config files into Galaxy because of potential security issues (circos can shell out.)

### Supported Features

- Covers *most* of the possibilities of Circos
- Can auto convert GFF3/BED/(big)Wig datasets into appropriate formats
- Supports common Circos features like:
	- histograms
	- heatmaps
	- "tile" (from gff3/bed)
	- line
	- scatter
	- ribbons
- Complex Circos visualisations made easy (Thanks Galaxy!)

### Tracks: Histograms

- For data which associate a position with a value
- Can be good for
  - Gene density on large genomes
  - Variation density?
  - GC Skew

### Tracks: Heatmaps

- Similar use case to histograms
- Histograms may provide easier quantification for viewers

![Heatmap Plot](../../images/circos-heatmap.png)

???

It can be eaiser to quantify differences between two values next to each other with the histogram than relying on the viewer's ability to distinguish + quantify how far apart two colours lie on a colour scale. These can be pretty but are harder to extract data from

### Tracks: Tiles

- Show genomic regions
- Great for genes on small genomes



![Tile Plot](../../images/circos-tiles.png)

???
"Tile tracks are used to show spans such as genomic regions (genes, exons, duplications) or coverage elements (clones, sequence reads). Tiles will stack within their track to avoid overlap." (circos documentation)
